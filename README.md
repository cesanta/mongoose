Mongoose is the most easy to use web server on the planet. A web server of choice for Web developers (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc) and Web designers.

Mongoose is built on top of Libmongoose embedded library, which can turn
anything into a web server in 5 minutes worth of effort and few lines of code.
Libmongoose is used to serve Web GUI on embedded devices, implement RESTful
services, RPC frameworks (e.g. JSON-RPC), handle telemetry data exchange, and
perform many other tasks in various different industries including aerospace,
manufacturing, finance, research, automotive, gaming, IT.
