Mongoose is ideal for embedded environments. It has been designed
for connecting devices and bringing them online. Mongoose
is on the market since 2004, used by vast number of open source and
commercial products - it even runs on space stations!

Mongoose provides easy to use event-driven interface that allows to implement
network protocols or scalable network applications  with little effort.
Mongoose helps developers to manage the complexity of network programming
and let them concentrate on the logic, saving time and money.
