@section lwip lwIP for MCUXpresso SDK
  Lightweight IP (lwIP) is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite.
  Source code included in this SDK is based on development version 2.2.1 taken from 3rd party lwIP GIT repository.
  The webpage https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git allows to browse the repository and also contains URLs for its cloning.
  The development versions (X.Y.Z.dev) do not refer to a single source code snapshots. To avoid ambiguity,
  change log below contains SHA-1 hashes of GIT commits used when importing the code into the SDK.

  - 2.2.1_rev2
    - Bug fixes:
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed calculation of the number of UDP datagrams to transmit.
        When the desired rate was high and datagram size small, the ideal delay between
        each transmitted datagram could be smaller than 1 microsecond. The value was
        truncated to zero and resulted in zero-division and/or no UDP transmitted at all.
      - port/arch/cc.h: code which checks for the presence of Newlib standard C library
        adds import of a standard header first so the __NEWLIB__ macro is always available
        when Newlib is used. This prevents LWIP_TIMEVAL_PRIVATE from having different values
        in one program.

  - 2.2.1_rev1
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.1.dev (2024-02-19, branch: master, SHA-1: d0efd9ef7ba08e54b46b1060e2b4629a4907391b) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - Added ETH_MAX_RX_PKTS_AT_ONCE macro. See port/README.md for details.
      - In port/netc_ethernetif.c, added NETC_VSI_NUM_USED macro to support using VSI. A thread of SI
        message handling will be started to handle VSI-PSI messages.
    - Bug fixes:
      - Added the missing implementation for IP_FORWARD_ALLOW_TX_ON_RX_NETIF option in the function ip6_forward.
        Therefore IPv6 packets could be sent back out on the netif where they where originally received from.
      - NETC adaptation layer: Do not call xEventGroupSetBits from ISR.
    - Ethernet adaptation layers: Default value of priority of the receive task (ETH_RX_TASK_PRIO) is set lower
      than the priority of the FreeRTOS daemon task (timer task).

  - 2.2.0_rev11
    - New features:
      - NETC adaptation layer: Possible to disable IPv4/TCP/UDP checksum validation done in HW.
      - EtherCAT EoE(Ethernet over EtherCAT) driver is added to lwip.
    - Bug fixes:
      - src/apps/httpsrv/httpsrv_supp.c: Fixed performing of the HTTP server task priority limitation.

  - 2.2.0_rev10
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0 (2023-09-25, branch: master, SHA-1: 0a0452b2c39bdd91e252aef045c115f88f6ca773, tag: STABLE-2_2_0_RELEASE) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - Enabled hardware-accelerated CRC computation and verification (MAC, IPv4, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4, ICMPv6) for ENET Kinetis, ENET QoS and ENET LPC.
      - Enabled link state detection based on PHY interrupts. 
        The ETH_LINK_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS macro controls this - setting it to 0 and specifying ethernetif_config_t->phyIntGpio enables it, setting it to a value greater
        than zero enables polling instead. Supported only under an RTOS (NO_SYS == 0). By default, the link state is polled.
      - ND6: Implemented RFC 4191 type C host, which means default router list (learned from Router Advertisement messages)
        has been replaced with routing table, which contains default route records for each router and also routes learned
        from received Route Information Options. Changes partially based on https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?10114.
        The option LWIP_ND6_NUM_ROUTERS has been removed, and the new option LWIP_ND6_NUM_ROUTES has been added
        to configure the size of the routing table.
      - IPv6: Implemented a new hook - LWIP_HOOK_IP6_CANFORWARD. This hook can be used, for example, for multicast 
        forwarding between netifs. Defining this hook enables multicast traffic forwarding, thus the hook is also invoked
        for multicast traffic.
      - MLD6: Multicast Listener Discovery v1 replaced by v2 (RFC 3810) but without support of source specific multicast.
      - port/enet_ethernetif_kinetis.c: Added check to generate/validate ICMPv6 checksum in SW as the Kinetis ENET peripheral does not do it.
      - Added disabling of Rx interrupt when the port is out of Rx buffers. See port/README.md for more details.
    - Bug fixes:
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed access to invalid data when UDP report is to be sent from a timer but abort has been called before.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed deallocation of TCP server started by client (in reverse or dual modes) which failed to connect.
      - port/netc_ethernetif.c: Fixed cache control enablement macro (FSL_SDK_ENABLE_DRIVER_CACHE_CONTROL > FSL_ETH_ENABLE_CACHE_CONTROL).
      - port/sys_arch.c: The function sys_assert does not call portENTER_CRITICAL when called from an interrupt.
      - src/core/ipv4/ip4.c: Fixed checksum reset condition.
      - ND6:
        - Lladdr length is now taken from netif->hwaddr_len so ND6 works properly regardless of NETIF_MAX_HWADDR_LEN.
        - Added check of sufficient length of lladdr options from incoming messages.
      - src/apps/httpsrv/httpsrv.c: Fixed hangup in HTTPSRV_release if caller's task has higher priority than server task.
    - port/arch/cc.h: LWIP_PLATFORM_DIAG is defined (and can be overridden) independently of the LWIP_DEBUG setting.
      Removed printing extra newline symbols from LWIP_PLATFORM_DIAG.
    - src/apps/lwiperf: The "end of test" UDP datagram is resent more often.
      This increases the probability of the server to receive it and end the test when datagrams are getting lost.
    - Added port/README.md describing possible settings and helper functions in the port layer.

  - 2.2.0_rev9
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2023-01-03, branch: master, SHA-1: 3fe8d2fc43a9b69f7ed28c63d44a7744f9c0def9) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - Applied patch to allow sending IPv6 router advertisement. Improved to allow selection of interface and router life time 
        and to allow sending route information options.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Support for reverse test (client receives, server sends). Requires iperf version 2.1.0 or newer.
    - Bug fixes:
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Fixed operation with LWIP_IPV6 enabled. Server can be also accessed using both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same
        time if compiled with both LWIP_IPV4=1 and LWIP_IPV6=1.
        Note the type of the field struct httpsrv_param_struct.address has changed from struct sockaddr to struct sockaddr_storage.

  - 2.2.0_rev8
    - New features:
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Added new parameter "buffer_len" to functions lwiperf_start_tcp_client() and lwiperf_start_udp_client()
        to configure TCP/UDP packet size.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Added new parameter "tos" to functions lwiperf_start_tcp_client() to configure TCP packet priority.
      - NETC adaptation layer: Not forcing the RX/TX buffers placement in non-cacheable memory.
        Requires the symbol FSL_ETH_ENABLE_CACHE_CONTROL to be defined on project level if the memory region,
        where the buffers are placed by a linker, has cache enabled.
    - Bug fixes:
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Added missing includes.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed TCP client to send settings at the beginning of each 128 KB block like the PC iperf 2.0.x application does.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed validation of TCP received data (with LWIPERF_CHECK_RX_DATA enabled, works with iperf 2.0.x).
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed lwiperf_list_remove() to clear references to the removed item.
    - src/apps/lwiperf: Program does not assert when buffer cannot be cloned in UDP test, only "can't clone buffer" message is printed.

  - 2.2.0_rev7
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2022-05-09, branch: master, SHA-1: 239918ccc173cb2c2a62f41a40fd893f57faf1d6) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - Added function ethernetif_probe_link() which reads actual link, speed and duplex settings from phy and passes them to driver.
        Stack could be set to call this function periodically by setting ETH_LINK_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS to value higher than zero.
      - Added helper functions ethernetif_wait_linkup() and ethernetif_wait_ipv4_valid() to allow blocking of RTOS task or 
        bare metal application until link is up or IPv4 address becomes valid.
      - Added NETC adaptation layer.
      - Processing of rx packets under RTOS moved from ISR to a separate task to improve system reaction times.
        Switch back to old behavior can be done by setting ETH_DO_RX_IN_SEPARATE_TASK macro to 0.
    - Bug fixes:
      - port: Fixed copying of pbuf contents. Previous code was using an incorrect end condition and could result
        in the overrun of the destination buffer if more packets were on the queue.
      - port: Delegating pbuf_free calls to tcpip_thread via pbuf_free_callback where possible (RTOS),
        ensured pbuf_free is not called from interrupt context when LWIP_ALLOW_MEM_FREE_FROM_OTHER_CONTEXT is not set (bare metal).
      - port/enet_ethernetif_qos.c - Fixed ENET_RXBD_NUM which was used instead of ENET_TXBD_NUM.
      - port/enet_ethernetif_qos.c - Fixed buffer alignment to be at least 64.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Fixed IPv6 TCP TX throughput lower than IPv4 by modifying maximum segment size
        to avoid sending two segments instead of one.
      - src/apps/lwiperf: Out-of-order datagrams in UDP RX server mode are counted to the throughput.
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Implemented receive timeouts on sockets.
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Don't assert on HTTP session task creation failure.
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Fixed build with IPv6 enabled.
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Updated endianess macros required for websocket SHA generation.
      - src/apps/httpsrv: Added missing includes.

  - 2.2.0_rev6
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2022-03-25, branch: master, SHA-1: 124dc0a64ef5d7c14a27e3115e5888df6559cb72) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - Implemented leaving of multicast groups on ENET and ENET QOS.

  - 2.2.0_rev5
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2021-05-11, branch: master, SHA-1: 7ec4e9be304e7f8953740f10b2c810a292e89449) to MCUXpresso SDK.
      - LPC ENET adaptation layer allocates more buffers for frame reception now.
        Previously the number of receive buffers was determined by ENET_RXBD_NUM, which defaults to 5.
        It is determined by ENET_RXBUFF_NUM now, which is 2 * ENET_RXBD_NUM by default.
        Increase was needed because the actual version of LPC ENET driver always hold ENET_RXBD_NUM number of buffers
        and few additional buffers are needed for passing zero-copy frame data to lwIP.
        If this takes too much memory in your application, you can counteract by decreasing PBUF_POOL_SIZE,
        since PBUF_POOL is used only for transmission when LPC ENET, Kinetis ENET or ENET QOS is used.

  - 2.2.0_rev4
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2021-03-05, branch: master, SHA-1: 0056522cc974d2be2005c324f37187b5b3695765) to KSDK 2.0.0.
      - LWIP_DHCP_DOES_ACD_CHECK option default changed to 0 (disabled):
        - Although the ACD check makes getting IP address from DHCP more robust, it added several seconds delay at startup of all applications which use DHCP.
        - This feature was not present in earlier versions of lwIP.
      - ENET QOS adaptation layer - implemented zero-copy on receive.
      - Kinetis ENET and ENET QOS adaptation layers allocate more buffers for frame reception now.
        Previously the number of receive buffers was determined by ENET_RXBD_NUM, which defaults to 5.
        It is determined by ENET_RXBUFF_NUM now, which is 2 * ENET_RXBD_NUM by default.
        Increase was needed because the actual version of Kinetis ENET and ENET QOS drivers always hold ENET_RXBD_NUM number of buffers
        and few additional buffers are needed for passing zero-copy frame data to lwIP.
        If this takes too much memory in your application, you can counteract by decreasing PBUF_POOL_SIZE,
        since PBUF_POOL is used only for transmission when Kinetis ENET or ENET QOS is used.
      - Removed ethernetif_config_t.non_dma_memory field which was required to configure memory ranges unusable by ENET DMA on LPC devices.
        The setting has been replaced by BOARD_ENET_NON_DMA_MEMORY_ARRAY macro.

  - 2.2.0_rev3
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2020-07-07, branch: master, SHA-1: c385f31076b27efb8ee37f00cb5568783a58f299) to KSDK 2.0.0.

  - 2.2.0_rev2
    - New features:
      - Kinetis ENET adaptation layer - implemented zero-copy on receive.
      - lwiperf - counter of transferred bytes extended from 32 to 64 bit
    - Bug fixes:
      - Fixed restarting Auto IP from DHCP.

  - 2.2.0_rev1
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.2.0.dev (2019-12-12, branch: master, SHA-1: 555812dcec38c9a2ef1ef9b31816291549fbf9f8) to KSDK 2.0.0.
      - Implemented LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED related functions in sys_arch.c. It can be enabled in lwipopts.h:
        - <tt>\#define LWIP_ASSERT_CORE_LOCKED() sys_check_core_locking()</tt>
        - <tt>\#define LWIP_MARK_TCPIP_THREAD() sys_mark_tcpip_thread() // if NO_SYS == 0</tt>
        - <tt>\#define LOCK_TCPIP_CORE() sys_lock_tcpip_core() // if NO_SYS == 0 and LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING == 1</tt>
        - <tt>\#define UNLOCK_TCPIP_CORE() sys_unlock_tcpip_core() // if NO_SYS == 0 and LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING == 1</tt>

  - 2.1.2_rev5
    - New features:
      - Implemented TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket option.

  - 2.1.2_rev4
    - New features:
      - Ported lwIP 2.1.3.dev (2019-02-27, branch: STABLE-2_1_x, SHA-1: 1bb6e7f52de1cd86be0eed31e348431edc2cd01e) to KSDK 2.0.0.
      - Updated sys_thread_new implementation and comment.
      - Kinetis ENET adaptation layer - reading frames into a pbuf chain is conditionally compiled only when a single pbuf from pool
        cannot hold maximum frame size (PBUF_POOL_BUFSIZE >= maximum frame size).
        Avoiding this code also reduces stack size requirements by about 1.5 kilobytes.
    - Bug fixes:
      - Fixes in ethernetif_linkoutput() in enet_ethernetif_lpc.c:
        - Removed access to possibly freed pbuf.
        - Call pbuf_free() when transmit buffers not available.
        - When copying pbuf chain, updating the number of necessary transmit buffers to wait for, which can be often smaller in the copy.
      - When CGI script is reading POST data by chunks, the loop in httpsrv_read() may cause blocking in receive function waiting for more data at the end of the stream
        - HTTPSRV_cgi_read() - added limiting of the last chunk length according to content length to avoid undesired blocking
      - Applied AUTOIP patch https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?9847 - with modification to support multiple network interfaces.
      - Fixed buffer overflow in httpsrv when application provided CGI script does not handle the whole content of POST request
    - Removed LwipMibCompiler contrib application as it contained LGPL licensed files in SharpSnmpLib.
